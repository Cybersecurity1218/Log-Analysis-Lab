# 📝 Log Analysis Lab

This project demonstrates how to analyze different types of log files for **failed login attempts** and **malware behaviors**. It includes fake log files and a Python script to process and analyze them.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install Python (if you don't have it already).
2. Download the log files and script.
3. Run the analysis script:
    ```bash
    python log_analysis.py
    ```

## 🔍 What It Analyzes
- Failed SSH login attempts
- Suspicious behaviors like reverse shells (netcat, bash, python)

## 📚 Logs
- `failed_login.log`: Simulates failed login attempts to the server.
- `malware_behavior.log`: Simulates suspicious activity indicating malware (reverse shells).
- `successful_login.log`: Successful logins (just for context).
